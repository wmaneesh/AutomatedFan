# Instructions # 
The system will provide the user with the option to switch between automated mode and
manual mode. The system modes can be set through the mounted button beside the fan as shown in figure below. The four seven-segment LEDs that are on the left side would display the ambient room temperature when the system is turned on and when the system is turned off it would display ‘-off’. The single seven-segment display on the right shows the fan speed when set in manual mode. The fan
speeds vary from levels 1 to 3, one being the slowest and 3 being the fastest. The figure below shows the displays
when the system is turned on and on manual mode with fan speed set to 3.
